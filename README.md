# Ajahn Brahmali's Vinaya Notes

This repo contains the source code for converting
[**Ajahn Brahmali's Vinaya Notes**](https://suttacentral.net/edition/pli-tv-vi/en/brahmali/preface?lang=en)
into a set of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files
suitable for importing into a
[notes app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_note-taking_software)
or converting into an ebook format with e.g. [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

The code here pulls the latest version of the notes from the SuttaCentral API.
Note that this may be slightly out-of-date compared to the latest in Bilara,
depending on when new data was last pushed to SuttaCentral's production server.
